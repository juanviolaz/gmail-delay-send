Welcome to the gmail-delay-send-jv Google Script! This is a fork of an original project found at:

## Notes
I've added the *-jv* suffix to help differentiate it from all the other forks and the original as well. When found, it wasn't working properly, so I forked it to Github and fixed a bug. Feel free to contribute if you find any bugs by reporting the issue and/or fixing the code directly.
